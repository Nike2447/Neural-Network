# Neural-Network
The above code contains a simple neural network created by me using data from MNIST database for image recognition

The neural network takes a 28x28 input of values ranging from 0-255 and outputs the predicted value of the number in the image

Network achieved a maximum efficiency of 97.2% 

Due to github constraints the data file mnist_test and mnist_train were not uploaded.
